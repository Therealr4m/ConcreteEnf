      <div class="kicker">Shed base installation — step-by-step</div>
      <h2 class="h2">Ground prep, load-bearing concrete and drainage</h2>

      <p> Every Enfield base is designed with four engineering decisions in mind:</p>

      <h3>1 — Ground preparation</h3>
      <p>Good concrete starts with the ground. The team starts off by removing topsoil, creating a compacted crushed stone sub-base then adding a geotextile membrane to reduce weed growth and movement. Proper sub-base compaction reduces settlement and keeps the base level for decades.</p>

      <h3>2 — Reinforcement & thickness</h3>
      <p>Choice of reinforcement depends on expected loads. For a typical garden shed used to store tools, mesh reinforcement and 100–120mm concrete is common. For heavier structures (log cabins, workshops) thicker slabs with steel mesh or rebar to distribute load are used.</p>

      <h3>3 — Drainage & fall</h3>
      <p>Surface fall is arranged to direct water away from buildings. Where required channels will be cut or drainage points will be fitted. This avoids standing water and protects timber structures above.</p>

      <h3>4 — Finish & tolerances</h3>
      <p>All work is finished to a smooth, level surface so your shed doors close easily and floors sit flat. Tolerances are kept tight — All measurements will be double checked before finishing your concrete base and leaving site.</p>

        <div class="kicker">Frequently asked — quick answers</div>
        <h3>How long does installation take?</h3>
        <p>Typical small shed bases can be completed in a day: prep in the morning and pour/finish in the afternoon. Larger or reinforced bases may need multiple days and longer curing.</p>

        <h3>Can I put a shed on paving or sleepers?</h3>
        <p>You can, but concrete bases give a totally level, long-lasting foundation. For timber sheds that store heavy loads, a concrete base is the lowest maintenance option.</p>

        <h3>Do you guarantee the work?</h3>
        <p>Workmanship assurances will be provided and clear terms given on every job. Ask for details when you call — and our reliable partners will explain exactly what's covered and the expected life-span for your concrete base in Enfield.</p>
