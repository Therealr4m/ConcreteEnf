      <span class="eyebrow">Why location matters</span>
      <h2 class="heading-lg">Local ground conditions & practical planning</h2>

      <p class="text">
        Shed base installation in Enfield requires an understanding of local soil conditions, water runoff patterns, and typical garden layouts. Some areas have heavier clay soil, while others require additional drainage consideration to prevent standing water.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        These factors directly influence how a garden shed concrete base Enfield should be prepared. Proper excavation depth, sub-base selection, and compaction methods are adjusted based on site conditions rather than applied as a standard template.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        This locally informed approach reduces long-term movement, improves drainage, and helps ensure your concrete base remains level and structurally sound for many years.
