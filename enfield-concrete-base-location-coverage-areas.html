      <p class="text">
        Yes — all concrete shed base installations are carried out across Enfield and selected
        surrounding residential areas where access allows.

    <div class="card">
      <span class="eyebrow">Local property context</span>
      <h2 class="heading-lg">Experience with Enfield homes & gardens</h2>

      <p class="text">
       From experience and local area knowledge we know Enfield properties can vary widely, which is why coverage isn’t treated as a one-size-fits-all approach. Different property types in the area have different access points, homeowners in Enfield could live as little 10 minutes away from each other but require completely different planning.
       <br>

        Most enquiries come from homeowners with:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Rear garden access only</li>
        <li>Side passages shared with neighbours</li>
        <li>Terraced or semi-detached housing</li>
        <li>Limited working space near boundaries</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text">
        These layouts are common across Enfield and surrounding areas, and are factored in when
        planning how or if your location can be served efficiently - in some cases, access may not be possible.

  <!-- CORE QUESTION: HOW IS COVERAGE DECIDED? -->
  <section class="section section--content">
    <div class="card">
      <span class="eyebrow">How coverage is assessed</span>
      <h2 class="heading-lg">What determines availability?</h2>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Your exact location</li>
        <li>Garden access and working space</li>
        <li>Neighbour proximity and restrictions</li>
        <li>Current scheduling in your area</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text">
        If you're not sure about what type of access is viable because you're not familiar with trade work thats fine, as long as you can describe your location & access on the phone, the team will confirm by actually speaking to you  —
        making it easier to give accurate answers quickly.
