      How Long Do Shed Bases Take To Install in Enfield?
    </h1>

    <p class="text">
      One of the most common questions Enfield homeowners ask before ordering a shed, summerhouse or log cabin is simple: <strong>how long will the concrete base actually take?</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The short answer is that most concrete shed bases in Enfield are installed in a single day, but the full timeline includes more than just pouring concrete. Booking, surveying, preparation, access, weather, curing time and when the shed can safely go on all affect the overall schedule.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      This guide explains the full process properly from a local Enfield installer’s point of view, so you know what to expect before work starts in your garden.

      Step One — Booking & Local Survey in Enfield
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
      The timeline starts with booking and assessing the job. Most Enfield properties are residential terraces, semis and detached homes with rear gardens, side access, shared driveways or alleyways. That access affects how equipment and concrete are brought in.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      During this stage we look at:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Garden access width and route to the base location</li>
      <li>Existing ground condition and slope</li>
      <li>Soil type (Enfield often has heavy clay)</li>
      <li>Drainage and water run-off</li>
      <li>Size and weight of the structure going on top</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">
      In Enfield, many gardens aren’t open building sites, so planning access avoids delays on the day. Booking and survey is usually quick and often done the same week you call.

    <span class="eyebrow">Ground preparation</span>

    <h2 class="heading-lg">
      Step Two — Site Preparation Time
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
      Preparation is the most important part of a concrete shed base installation. Pouring onto poorly prepared ground leads to movement, cracking and water pooling later.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      In Enfield gardens, preparation normally includes excavation, removing turf, levelling the area, installing a weed membrane and creating a compacted sub-base so the concrete sits on something stable rather than soft soil. 
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Because Enfield soil often contains clay, we take extra care with depth and compaction. Clay holds water and expands, so proper preparation prevents future movement under your shed or log cabin.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      For most residential gardens, preparation takes between <strong>1 and 3 hours</strong> depending on size, access and existing ground condition. You can see if your area around Enfield is covered for a concrete base install below: <br> <a class="blog-link" href="/enfield-concrete-base-location-coverage-areas.html">Concrete base in Enfield - coverage areas</a>

    <h2 class="heading-lg">
      Step Three — Installation & Pouring the Base
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
      Once preparation is complete, the concrete base itself is installed. This includes setting timber edging, checking levels, adding reinforcement where needed, pouring the concrete and finishing the surface.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      For Enfield residential jobs, the actual pour and finish is usually efficient once access is planned properly. Most standard shed bases are poured, levelled and finished within a few hours.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Typical pour timeframes in Enfield:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Small shed base: 1–2 hours</li>
      <li>Medium garden room base: 2–3 hours</li>
      <li>Large log cabin base: 3–4 hours</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">
      Including preparation, most Enfield shed base installations are completed on site the same day.

    <span class="eyebrow">Size matters</span>

    <h2 class="heading-lg">
      How Base Size Affects Installation Time
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
      The size of your shed or building directly affects how long the base takes. Larger bases need more excavation, more concrete, more levelling and often reinforcement.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Typical Enfield examples:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>6x4 shed base</strong> – Quick prep and pour, often completed within half a day.</li>
      <li><strong>8x6 shed base</strong> – Slightly more excavation and levelling, usually same-day completion.</li>
      <li><strong>10x8 shed base</strong> – More concrete and finishing time, but still normally installed in one visit.</li>
      <li><strong>Log cabins & garden rooms</strong> – Thicker slabs, possible reinforcement, longer prep and finishing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">
      Bigger bases don’t usually add days, but they do increase on-site working time and curing consideration before the structure goes on top, as the heavier your structure, the longer the concrete has to cure.

    <span class="eyebrow">Local factors</span>

    <h2 class="heading-lg">
      Weather, Access & Enfield Garden Layouts
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
      London and Enfield weather plays a role in timing. Heavy rain, frost or extreme heat can affect pouring and curing. Wet clay soil in particular needs correct handling so the base doesn’t trap moisture underneath.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Access also matters. Many Enfield homes have narrow side passages, terraced layouts or long rear gardens. Planning delivery and movement of materials keeps the job flowing properly without delays.
    </p>

   

     <p class="text">
     Another factor that can affect how long a shed base takes in Enfield is planning permission. Most garden sheds and bases fall under permitted development rights, meaning you dont need to apply for planning because it's in your rights to have certain work done. If you're going to have a large log cabin or garden room sitting on the base, it's important checking before work starts.
     <br> the Gov link for guidance can be found below in the next paragraph
     </p>

     <p class="text">
     If a homeowner has to confirm whether they need planning permission because they're having a larger project sit on the base, it can add a little more time before installation is booked. Government guidance on outbuildings and permitted development is available on 
     <a href="https://www.gov.uk/planning-permission-england-wales" class="blog-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gov.uk planning permission guidance</a>, and it’s worth reviewing for bigger structures so your base installation isn’t delayed later in the project.

    <h2 class="heading-lg">
      Curing Time — When Can the Shed Go On?
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
      Many homeowners think once the concrete is poured the shed can go straight on, but curing time matters for strength and durability.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      In Enfield conditions:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>24 hours – Safe to walk on carefully.</li>
      <li>48 hours – Light structures may be positioned.</li>
      <li>5–7 days – Good working strength.</li>
      <li>28 days – Full concrete cure strength.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">
      We normally advise Enfield customers to wait at least <strong>48–72 hours</strong> before installing a shed, and longer for heavy log cabins or garden rooms.
