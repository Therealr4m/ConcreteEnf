        <h2 class="heading-lg">
          Is a concrete base really necessary for a garden shed?
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
          This is one of the most common questions Enfield homeowners ask before installing a new shed.
          The short answer is: <strong>not every shed strictly requires concrete</strong> — but for most gardens in Enfield, a concrete base is the safest, longest-lasting option.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Sheds fail early for one main reason: the base underneath them moves, sinks, or holds water.
          A properly installed <strong>Concrete Shed Base Enfield</strong> service eliminates those issues by creating a level, load-bearing foundation designed for British ground conditions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">What happens if a shed sits on a poor base?</h3>

        <p class="text">
          Even a high-quality shed can suffer if the base isn’t right. Over time you may notice:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Doors that stick or no longer close properly</li>
          <li>Floors that feel soft or uneven underfoot</li>
          <li>Water pooling around the base after rain</li>
          <li>Timber panels absorbing moisture and rotting early</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">
          These problems are especially common in Enfield gardens with clay soil or poor natural drainage.
          Once a shed starts to twist or sink, repairs are difficult — and often more expensive than installing the correct base from the start.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">When a concrete shed base is strongly recommended</h3>

        <p class="text">
          A concrete base isn’t just about strength — it’s about stability and longevity.
          You should seriously consider a concrete base if any of the following apply:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Your shed is larger than a basic tool store</li>
          <li>You plan to store heavy equipment or machinery</li>
          <li>The shed will be used as a workshop or home office</li>
          <li>The garden ground is uneven or slopes</li>
          <li>You want a low-maintenance, long-term solution</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">
          In these situations, a professionally installed <strong>Concrete Shed Base Enfield</strong> setup provides a flat, solid platform that protects both the structure and anything stored inside.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">
          Are alternatives like paving slabs or timber bearers enough?
        </h3>

        <p class="text">
          Slabs, sleepers and plastic grids can work for very small sheds — but they come with limitations.
          Individual slabs can shift independently, timber bearers can rot, and lightweight systems rarely offer proper drainage control.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Concrete, when installed correctly, acts as a single reinforced slab.
          This distributes weight evenly, resists movement, and keeps the shed square for years without adjustment.
        </p>

        <p class="text-small">
          Homeowners who plan to keep their shed long-term usually choose concrete to avoid future problems.

      <h2 class="heading-lg">What makes a good concrete shed base?</h2>

      <p class="text">
        Not all concrete bases are the same. A proper installation focuses on what’s underneath the slab just as much as the concrete itself.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-md">Ground preparation</h3>

      <p class="text">
        Topsoil is removed, a compacted sub-base is installed, and a membrane is added to reduce movement and weed growth.
        This is crucial for Enfield gardens where soil can retain moisture.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-md">Correct thickness & reinforcement</h3>

      <p class="text">
        Most garden sheds require 100–120mm of concrete, with reinforcement added for heavier loads.
        This prevents cracking and spreading under weight.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-md">Drainage and finish</h3>

      <p class="text">
        Slight falls are built into the slab so water runs away from the shed, not toward it.
        The finished surface is smooth and level, allowing doors to operate correctly.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        This is why homeowners often choose a specialist <strong>Concrete Shed Base Enfield</strong> service rather than general groundwork.
