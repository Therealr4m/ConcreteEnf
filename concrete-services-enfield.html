      <p class="text">
        Shed base installation in Enfield isn’t just about pouring concrete. It’s about understanding ground conditions, expected loads, drainage requirements, and how the finished base will support the structure above it over time.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Each concrete base for shed Enfield projects is approached with precision and care. The goal is simple: a base that stays flat, drains correctly, and doesn’t shift or crack under normal use.
      </p>

      <p class="text">This service is suitable for:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Garden sheds and storage buildings</li>
        <li>Summerhouses and garden rooms</li>
        <li>Log cabins and timber structures</li>
        <li>Small workshops and hobby spaces</li>

      <p class="text">
        Even the best shed will deteriorate quickly if it’s installed on an uneven or poorly prepared surface. Common problems caused by inadequate bases include:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Doors sticking or binding over time</li>
        <li>Water pooling on the floor or around the structure</li>
        <li>Timber frames twisting due to movement</li>
        <li>Premature rot and structural wear</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text">
        A well-designed garden shed concrete base in Enfield eliminates these issues. Correct depth, reinforcement where required, and a properly compacted sub-base ensure the slab remains stable and level long-term.

  <!-- INSTALLATION PROCESS -->
  <section class="section section--content">
    <div class="card">
      <span class="eyebrow">Installation method</span>
      <h2 class="heading-lg">The Shed Base Installation Process</h2>

      <h3 class="heading-md">1. Ground Preparation</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Good concrete starts below ground level. Topsoil is removed to reach a stable base, then a crushed stone sub-base is installed and mechanically compacted. A geotextile membrane may be used where ground conditions require extra stability and weed control.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Strong sub-base compaction reduces settlement and keeps the base level for decades.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-md">2. Depth & Reinforcement</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Concrete depth is selected based on shed size and intended use. Light garden sheds typically require around 100–120mm, while heavier structures such as log cabins or workshops may need thicker slabs and steel reinforcement.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Reinforcement options include mesh or rebar, used where needed to distribute loads and reduce cracking.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-md">3. Drainage & Falls</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Standing water shortens the life of both concrete and timber. Subtle falls are built into the slab to encourage runoff, and drainage details are planned to suit the site and structure.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        This helps protect sheds, keeps floors dry, and prevents long-term moisture problems.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-md">4. Finishing & Accuracy</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Once poured, the concrete is finished to a smooth, level surface. Measurements are double-checked before completion to ensure sheds sit square, doors open freely, and floors remain flat.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        The result is a clean, professional base ready for immediate or future shed installation.
